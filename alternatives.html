				<h4>Healthy Diet</h4>
				<img src="Project-pics/healthy-heart.png">

				<p>A healthy diet is a large part of physical health. Eating the right food will help to filter out
					toxins and instead nourish our bodies. We all need the right nutrition to feel our best.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="element">
				<h4>Excercise</h4>
				<img src="Project-pics/joggers.png">

				<p>Another part of physical health is excercise. Staying active either by going for walks, jogging, or
					going to the gym helps our bodies to remember how to produce endorphins and the other "feel good"
					hormones.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="element">
				<h4>Yoga</h4>
				<img src="Project-pics/beach-yoga.png">

				<p>Another way to help calm our minds and connect with our inner selves is with yoga. It is a good way
					to stretch and stregnthen muscles, focus breathing, and meditate.</p>

			<div class="element">
				<h4>Acupuncture</h4>
				<img src="Project-pics/acupuncture.png">
				<p>Another way to deal with the stress and anxiety of getting clean is with acupuncture. This can also
					be used to help curb cravings and urges as well as the physical discomfort of early recovery.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="element">
				<h4>Volunteer</h4>
				<img src="Project-pics/dog.png">

				<p>Helping others really puts our own lives and pain into perspective. Volunteering can be a great way
					to take yourself out of your own troubles and focus on helping another, whether it is an animal or
					another person.</p>
