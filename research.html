                        That is the most important step, but it is only the beginning of the journey. There are many
                        areas that should be addressed. This is where it is imporatnt to look inward and start healing
                        by looking at root causes and past trauma. Sometimes it hurts to heal, but the hurt is only
                        temporary and can open the door to so much happiness!</p>

                        the effort! Recovery is often attained with a complete overhaul of lifestyle. For many, this
                        means changing everything, from the food they eat, to learning to sustain healthy relationships.
                        A personal program of recovery should address all aspects of the recovering addicts life.</p>

                        more than just ourselves. Addiction effects the whole family and so recovery should also include
                        the whole family. It is important to incorporate all aspects of the self toward healing. The
                        better a person feels in recovery, the more they are likely to stick with it and to succeed long
                        term.</p>
